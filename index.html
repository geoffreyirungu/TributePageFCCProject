        Craig achieved international fame when chosen as the sixth actor to play Ian Fleming's British secret agent James Bond in the eponymous film series, taking over from Pierce Brosnan in 2005. His debut film as Bond, Casino Royale, was released internationally in November 2006 and was highly acclaimed, earning him a BAFTA nomination and becoming the highest grossing in the series at the time. Quantum of Solace followed in 2008. His third Bond film, Skyfall, premiered in 2012 and is currently the highest-grossing film in the series and the 27th-highest-grossing film of all time; it was also the highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom until 2015. He reprised his role in Spectre (2015), and will return for the fifth and final time as Bond in No Time to Die (April 2020).
